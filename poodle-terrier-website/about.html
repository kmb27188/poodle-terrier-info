			<h2>About</h2>
			<p> 
             I made this website because I own three poodle terriers that mean the world to me and my family. I had no <br/>idea what wonderful dogs they would be until we got our first one in 2015. Since then we have gone back <br/>to the same breeder to get the second and third dogs in 2018 and 2020. They are the most loving and <br/>loyal dogs that you can imagine and I honestly donâ€™t know how we survived without them. I want everyone <br/>to know that they are a wonderful pick for a pet and they are definitely a mix you should look into if you are <br/>looking for a small, hypoallergenic dog that will be a loyal companion.
