			 Poodles originated in Germany and Terriers <br/>orginated in England. Poodles were originally <br/>bred as hunters, bringing birds back to their <br/>owners and Terriers were originally bred to kill <br/>vermin. Both Poodles and Terriers are active <br/>dogs and are great around children. This makes <br/>them great family pets.
