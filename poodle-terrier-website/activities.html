			<p> 
             It is important to exercise with your dog everyday and taking them on a walk around the neighborhood is the <br/>best way to do it.  Even taking them on a 15 to 20 minute walk a day will keep them fit and it will be beneficial <br/>to you as well. Giving them plenty of toys to play with at home is a great way to bond with them. This will <br/>lead to exercise inside the house, too as they will constantly bring you their toys to throw to them. You can <br/>also take them to a dog park to play with other dogs but I would be careful about that right now since there <br/>is a respiratory virus going around for dogs. Once we get past the winter months, dog parks will probably <br/>be a better option.
