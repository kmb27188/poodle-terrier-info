			<h2>Food</h2>
			<p> 
             There are a lot of brands of dog food like Blue Buffalo, Purina One, IAMS, Pedigree, etc.  I feed my dogs <br/>Purina One dog food  with a blend of real turkey and venison because it was recommended by my vet <br/>and they love it.  We fill up their bowls once in the morning with food and give them treats throughout the <br/>day. Poodle Terriers are very good at pacing themselves with food throughout the day so there is no need <br/>to feed a cup here and there. They do go through quite a bit of water though so we do need to fill those up <br/>more than once a day. We also keep water upstairs and downstairs for them so they can have it <br/>throughout the day and night.
